    <p>
      This meatball stroganoff was a hit with everyone. I came up with this easy
      recipe that's quick to prepare because my family loves stroganoff so much!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>15 frozen beef meatballs, or more to taste</li>
      <li>8 ounces broad egg white noodles (such as No Yolks®)</li>
      <li>¾ cup sour cream</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic;
        cook and stir until onion is almost soft, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium; stir in condensed soup, milk, and Worcestershire
        sauce. Add meatballs; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until
        tender, 35 to 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add
        noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
        bite, 10 to 12 minutes; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sour cream, salt, and pepper to meatballs in sauce. Cook until
        flavors combine, about 2 minutes. Serve meatballs over noodles.
      </li>
    </ol>
